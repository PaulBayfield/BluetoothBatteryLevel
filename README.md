# üöÄ ‚Ä¢ Presentation

Another random project I made to get the battery level of my Bluetooth devices. This script is made for Windows and uses powershell commands to:
1. Get the list of all Bluetooth devices
2. Get the instance ID of each device
3. Get the status of each device
4. Get the battery level of each device

# üì¶ ‚Ä¢ Installation

Clone the repository.

```bash
git clone https://PaulBayfield/BluetoothBatteryLevel.git
cd BluetoothBatteryLevel
```

# üìÑ ‚Ä¢ Usage

Run the [`bluetooth.py`](bluetooth.py) file.

```bash	
python3 bluetooth.py
```

You should see an output similar to this:

```bash
Initialising bluetooth...
Getting bluetooth devices...
Found 2 bluetooth devices
Getting bluetooth devices status...
Getting instances IDs...
> Phone - False - 
> Headphones - True - BTHENUM\{000...}_VID&000... 

Updating bluetooth devices...
[‚úò] Phone
[‚úî] Headphones - 30%
```
